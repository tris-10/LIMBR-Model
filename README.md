## Localized Intolerance Model using Bayesian Regression (LIMBR)

We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model explicitly characterizing depletion in
functional variation at both the gene and sub-regional level. Our manuscript
["Improved Pathogenic Variant Localization via a Hierarchical Model of
Sub-regionnal Intolerance"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929718305032)
contains more details along with our web resource can be found [here](https://tris-10.github.io/limbr])
